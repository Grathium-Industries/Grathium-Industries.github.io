            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Netflix Party (or Teleparty) is a simple web extension for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox that became popular during the 2020 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The extension allows you to watch Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and much more while you are not physically with them. The extension syncs your video with other people in the "party" and allows for a live chat and emoji reactions feature so your friends can comment on the video while it is playing. It also boasts features where if a person pauses or rewinds the video, the video on all other peoples videos will rewind and play at the same time. This is a great extension if you are looking to watch an online video with a friend who is not physically with you.
