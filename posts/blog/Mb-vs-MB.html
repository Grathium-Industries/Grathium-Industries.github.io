	<h1>Why is my Download Speed so Much Slower than Speed Tests</h1>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Have you ever gawked at your internet service providers (ISP's) advertised download speed; performed a speed test on a website such as <a href="https://fast.com">fast.com</a> or <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/">speedtest.net</a> and was thrilled to see your speed at 100Mbps; but then when you try to download anything off the internet or a game from Steam, the download seems to take so much longer than you expected for your 100Mbps internet? This is not because your web browser or  such as Steam is being slow, but because of the deceiving way bits and bytes work.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Short Answer</h2>
		<p>
			Your speed test and internet service provider is recording in a different measurement unit to your download. Your speed test is being measured in <code>Mbps</code>, while your download is being measured in <code>MBps</code> (note the capitalized <code>B</code>). The difference in measurements is a scalar factor of 8.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Long Answer</h2>
		<p>
			Bits and Bytes are two different ways of measuring data size. Bits are measured in the unit <code>bits</code> or <code>b</code> and Bytes are measured in <code>bytes</code> or <code>B</code>. A bits is the individual binary representation of a single state. For instance, a bit can take the value of <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. While a Byte is an ordered collection of 8 bits. An example of an 8-bit byte can be <code>10110100</code>. <br> <br> This is why when internet service providers or internet speed tests promise <code>100Mbps</code> internet, it is actually a tricky marketing tactic since most people can't differentiate between <code>Mbps</code> (mega bits per second) and MBps (mega bytes per second). <br> <br> These speeds often conflict with download files from websites and Steam since they are measured in <code>MBps</code> not <code>Mbps</code>. Since there are 8 bits in a byte, by doing the conversion from <code>MBps</code> and <code>Mbps</code>, you will find that there is a factor of 8 between the two. Making your speed test represent 8 times more download speed than you will realistically be able to download.
