            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Have you ever done a speed test and was thrilled to see your speed at 100Mbps; but then when you try to download anything off the internet or Steam, the download seems to take so much longer than you expected for your 100Mbps internet? This is not because your web browser or application such as Steam is being slow, but because of the deceiving way bits and bytes work.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Short Answer</h2>
            <p>
                Your speed test is recording in a different measurement unit to your download. Your speed test is being measured in <code>Mbps</code>, while your download is being measured in <code>MBps</code> (note the capitalized <code>B</code>). The difference in measurements is a factor of 8.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Long Answer</h2>
            <p>
                Bits and Bytes are a way of measuring speed. Bits are measured in <code>bits</code> or <code>b</code> and Bytes are measured in <code>bytes</code> or <code>B</code>. Bits is the individual binary representation of a single state. For instance, a bit can take the value of <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. While a Byte is an ordered collection of 8 bits. An example of an 8-bit byte can be <code>10110100</code>. <br>
                <br>
                This is why when internet service providers or internet speed tests promise <code>100Mbps</code> internet, it is actually a tricky marketing tactic since most people can't differentiate between <code>Mbps</code> (mega bits per second) and MBps (mega bytes per second). <br>
                <br>
                These speeds often conflict with download files from websites and Steam since they are measured in <code>MBps</code> not <code>Mbps</code>. Since there are 8 bits in a byte, by doing the conversion from <code>MBps</code> and <code>Mbps</code>, you will find that there is a factor of 8 between the two. Making your speed test represent 8 times more download speed than you will realistically be able to download.
