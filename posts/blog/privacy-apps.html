		<h1>Privacy Apps for your Grandma</h1>
        <h3 class="pub-time">18/07/2022</h3>
        <p>Historically, privacy preserving apps, and services have been notoriously difficult to configure and use. However, there are some easy and good alternatives to popular apps that provide strong privacy by default.

        <div>
            <ol>
                <div>
                    <li><h2>SIGNAL</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Homepage</a><br>
                    <p>
                        Signal is an encrypted private communications standard and application available on IOS and Android.There is sever risks, steep learning curve or features which I suggest disabling for the average user.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>Brave Web Browser</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://brave.com/">Homepage</a><br>
                    <p>
                        The Brave web browser is a freely available privacy by default web browser available on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The browser is shipped with a privacy by default model and is almost invisible to the user. The browser comes with a miriad of extra features that is not suited for the typical user such as your grandma. For this reason I suggest disabling Brave Rewards, new tab page cards, and sponsored background images. While the Brave Browser is not the best for privacy, it is best suited to the average user due to the good trade of privacy, and ease of use by default.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>1.1.1.1 DNS</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://1.1.1.1/">Homepage</a><br>
                    <p>
                        A DNS is used to resolve domain names to IP addresses. Historically, DNS servers are provided by your internet service provider (Verizon, AT&T, etc...) These DNS servers track and keep logs of all the websites you access. This information can be used to track you for targeted advertisements, and more.1.1.1.1 is a DNS server provided by Cloudflare and is a great privacy by default DNS server that is available on all platforms. The DNS server is shipped with a privacy by default model and is almost invisible to the user.
