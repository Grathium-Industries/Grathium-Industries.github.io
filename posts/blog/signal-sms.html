		<h1>Signal Messenger is Dropping Support For SMS in Upcoming Months</h1>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                On the 13<sup>th</sup> of October 2022, Signal announced on a <a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1580228175807754240">Twitter Status Update</a> that they would be removing support for the SMS protocol "soon" from their Android clients in upcoming months citing "interest of privacy, security, and clarity" <a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1580228175807754240">source</a>. This comes not long after Google's pushing for Apple to adopt 'modern' messaging standard <a href="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/technology/2022/08/google-pushing-apple-to-adopt-modern-messaging-standards.html">source</a>. <br>
                <br>
                But What will this mean for Android Signal users. Short answer: not much really, this update is welcome throughout the privacy community, with a Reddit post claiming that "Signal is dropping SMS support — and that's a good thing" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/y4c8zk/signal_is_dropping_sms_support_and_thats_a_good/">source</a>. This update will still allow users with modern smartphones to communicate. e.g. Android & Apple phones will still be able to work with Android Signal users & Apple messenger users because Apple supports MMS (the predecessor of SMS). <br>
                <br>
                However, this will negatively affect Signal users who are either users of lower end/older phones, and Signal users who contact users that use older mobile devices. However, since MMS was released in 2002 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service#:~:text=Multimedia%20messaging%20service%20was%20built,MMS%20started%20in%20March%202002.">source</a>, it has seen wide spread adoption, and is likely to come in any phones > 2004. <br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, Signal -> Signal communication on older devices which do not support MMS will still work. So if you have an contact with an older phone, it might be time to invite them to Signal. <br>
                <br>
                Overall, this is a step in the correct direction, as SMS has privacy metadata privacy concerns as SMS metadata is transmitted via plan text and not with any security measures regarding confidentiality of SMS contents. <br>
                <br>
                At the current moment in time, there is no indication on when this update will come into effect, but there will most likely be an announcement when the change has occurred.
