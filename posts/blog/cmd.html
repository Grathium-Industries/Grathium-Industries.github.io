			<h2>Fixes Errors</h2>
			<code>command is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file<br></code>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This <code>stderr</code> standard error stream is a common Windows command line issue experienced among new programers, and we are all to common with it. But what does it actually mean?<br>
				<br>
				The text "command is not recognized as an internal or external command" refers to executables or <code>.exe</code> files. This is stating that there is no <code>.exe</code> file with that name in the current directory, or in your <code>%PATH%</code> directories. A <code>%PATH%</code> directory is where command prompt looks for executables or <code>.exe</code> files when you type in a command. The most well known <code>%PATH%</code> directory is the <code>C:\Windows\System32</code> directory where programs such as <code>echo</code> and <code>shutdown</code> are located. Therefore, if you type in <code>echo "Hello World!"</code>, you are actually calling the <code>echo</code> program from within <code>C:\Windows\System32</code> with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_argument_parsing">command line argument</a> of <code>"Hello World!"</code>. Hence why if you delete this directory everything stops working.) <br>
				<br>
				The text "or batch file" inherits all the same ideas as the executables, but also contains the idea that you can run batch files (<code>.bat</code> and <code>.cmd</code>) files without specifying the <code>.bat</code> extension to the file path. <br>
				e.g. <code>helloWorld.bat</code> can be called by <code>helloWorld</code>
            </p>

			<h2>Fix</h2>
			<div>
				<b>If you are copying code from the internet</b>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>Check that you are running commands for windows command prompt, cmd, dos, or batch</li>
						<li>If there is a <code>$</code> at the start of the command, remove it and any leading spaces until the first alphanumeric character (as the <code>$</code> character represents that you should run the following from the command line / terminal)</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				
				<br>
				<b>General Fixes</b>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>Check that you have any programs you need installed</li>
						<li>Make sure your operating system is up-to date</li>
						<li>If you need to use a batch script <code>.bat</code> download the script first</li>
						<li>Make sure you are in the right directory path</li>
						<li>Make sure that your <code>%PATH%</code> environment variables contain the path to the executable </li>
					</ol>
				</p>

			<p>If all else fails, you may need to try a different solution.</p>
