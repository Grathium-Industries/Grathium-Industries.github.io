		<h1>Top Search Engines 2022</h1>
        <h3 class="pub-time">19/07/2022</h3>
        <p>
            Search engines are a staple in our modern day world. They help us answer questions like "What is the weather today", or "Recipes for pumpkin pie". However, while Google is synonymous with searching, most users only know the top 3 search engines. Google, Bing, Yahoo, and if your more technically savvy, maybe DuckDuckGo. However, there is a myriad of search engines that not many people know of. Today I am going to be listing the top search engines that you may not have heard of.
        </p>

        <div>
            <ol>
                <div>
                    <li><h2>Google</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://www.google.com/">Link</a><br>
                    <p>
                        We don't need to introduce Google. We have all used it at some point in our lives. It is user friendly and has a lot of features. It is also a great search engine if you don't mind giving up some of your privacy.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>Bing</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://www.bing.com/">Link</a><br>
                    <p>
                        Bing is the second most popular search engine. Bing fuels a lot of the top search engines in this list due to it's extensive API. It's search feature is lacking however, as it's search terms are a bit more strict. As the same with Google it is an okay search engine if you don't mind giving up some of your privacy. However, if your considering using Bing, you should probably use another search engine in this list which uses Bing, as you'll get the same search results; plus probably some extra features you may like.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>Yahoo</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://yahoo.com">Link</a><br>
                    <p>
                        Yahoo has lost some traction in the last couple of years. But it has remained as one of the top search engines in the market. It boasts one of the most comprehensive and useful homepages of all the search engines. However, it's search feature is lacking, as it uses Bing's search results, with less instant answers. If you are considering using Yahoo search, I suggest you change to Bing for better instant answers, and the same result. Or another search engine in this list which uses the Bing index.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>DuckDuckGo</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">Link</a><br>
                    <p>
                        DuckDuckGo is one of the leading privacy first search engines. It is currently the most popular privacy centric search engine in the world and boasts a lot of unique features, such as the DuckDuckGo <code>!bangs</code>. However, in recent years, it has lost some traction. It's search feature is lacking, as it uses Bing's search results, with less instant answers, and has been at the center of controversies such as censoring Russian search results and allowing tracking by Microsoft on their IOS and Android app in an attempt to gather advertising revenue from Microsoft Ads.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>Ecosia</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/">Link</a><br>
                    <p>
                        Ecosia is an environmentally conscious, net-zero, and privacy strong search engine. A large majority of their revenue is donated to environmental initiatives in an attempt to combat climate change. Their motto is "The simplest way to plant trees and be climate active every day". They use Bing's search results, and donate a majority of their revenue to environmental movements such as tree planting. This is a great search engine if you are looking to make a difference in the world, from your couch.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>Brave Search</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://search.brave.com/">Link</a><br>
                    <p>
                        Brave Search is a privacy centric and privacy first search engine which is feature filled and provides the average users best privacy alternative to Google. It features <code>!bangs</code> similar to DuckDuckGo, and has several features only seen in Brave Search, such as the Discussions panel, and Goggles. It gained popularity due to its independent search index, with more than 80% of its search results coming from its own index.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>Qwant</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://www.qwant.com/">Link</a><br>
                    <p>
                        Qwant is a popular privacy first search engine located in Europe. It comes with many features such as Qwant music, Qwant maps, and even has a search engine for kids called Qwant Junior. Qwant is a great search engine for non native english speakers who want to use a search engine which understands their native language better. Qwant is not targeted towards users outside of Europe, as you may experience lag while using their service.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>Swiss Cow</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://swisscows.com/">Link</a><br>
                    <p>
                        Swiss Cow is a search engine which is known for it's colorful "Related Search Queries", and charity work. It's related search queries are a great way to find information about your search query. It also has a charity feature, which is a great way to support charities. It is a great search engine if you are looking to make a difference in the world, from your couch.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>Search for a Cause</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://search.gladly.io/">Link</a><br>
                    <p>
                        Search for a Cause is a criminally under rated search engine for charity and social justice issues. Created by gladly.io, the creator or Tab for a Cause, Search for a Cause doesn't get a notable mention due to its better search results, or independent index. But rather it's charity work. Upon searching with Search for a Cause, the company will donate a percentage of the search revenue collected from ads to a charity of your choice from their collation of supported charity organisations.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>Dog Pile</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/">Link</a><br>
                    <p>
                        Dog Pile is one of the first search engines. Released in 1996, Dog Pile collects data from Google, Yahoo!, Yandex, Bing, among other popular search engines to bring together a large number of focused search results and features a cute dog as its mascot.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>Yandex</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://yandex.com/">Link</a><br>
                    <p>
                        Yandex is a Russian-Dutch search engine popular in Russia and is best known as the "Russian search engine". It is best used for its image search, and reverse image search feature. It is one of the most feature filled search engine that I have seen with a map feature, translate, and mail service. I recommend this search engine for users in eastern european countries who don't mind sacrificing their privacy for a better search experience.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>Mojeek</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://www.mojeek.com/">Link</a><br>
                    <p>
                        Mojeek is a search engine best known for having its own search index. It is a search engine best for the technical user who values search engine diversity.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>SearX</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://searx.me/">Link</a><br>
                    <p>
                        SearX is a search engine for the more technical. It is a very strong syntax search engine with a lot of features, and a privacy centric design. While you can use hosted web instances of the search engine, it is considered best practice if you host your own instance on either your computer or a mini server such as a Raspberry Pi. SearX is considered the leading and best search engine to use for the privacy minded individual.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>StartPage</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://www.startpage.com/">Link</a><br>
                    <p>
                        Search engine is the closet competitor to DuckDuckGo. Similar to DuckDuckGo, StartPage is a privacy first search engine with a large and dedicated user base. Unlike DuckDuckGo, StartPage fetches its search results from Google instead of Bing. This means that if you are used to Google's weak search syntax, you might find the search results on StartPage more useful than DuckDuckGo / Bing's index. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <li><h2>100 Search Engines</h2></li>
                    <a href="https://www.100searchengines.com/">Link</a><br>
                    <p>
                        100 Search Engines is built upon a simple philosophy. Instead of using a single search engine, 100 Search Engines uses a network of 100 search engines to provide you with the best results. Since each search engine is unique and searches their own site the best, 100 Search Engines is a great way to find the best results across 100 platforms.
