	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		.tar.gz files are compressed files and archives that are used to store data, and is primarily used by Linux / MacOS
		platforms for web downloads. Tar or "tape archiver" is a file format which combines multiple or directory files into
		a single file. gz or "gzip" is a compression format which is used to compress a singular file. Therefore, for this
		reason, tar is used to combine a directory into a single file, while gz is used to compress and reduce the size of
		the file.
