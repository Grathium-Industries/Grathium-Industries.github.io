## Description

The Brave Browser is a privacy centric Chromium browser built for the average consumer. However, some privacy strong users are known to use Android without the Google components, which prevent them from installing the Brave Browser through the Play Store. This is a simple solution to install the Brave Browser without the Play Store.

## Problem

The only Android app repository the Brave Browser is available on is the Play Store. No official app image is available on FDroid, or any FOSS app repositories.


## Solution

Download the Brave Browser from the Official GitHub Releases Page
[https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/releases](Brave Browser GitHub Releases Page)

For Android Distributions, it is recommended that you download the suitable APK install file suited for your architecture. The APK files can be found under the release > Assets
