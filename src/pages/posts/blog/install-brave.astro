		The Brave Browser is a privacy centric Chromium browser built for the average consumer. However, some privacy strong
		users are known to use Android without the Google components, which prevent them from installing the Brave Browser
		through the Play Store. This is a simple solution to install the Brave Browser without the Play Store.
