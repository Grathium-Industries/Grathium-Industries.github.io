  <p>
    Surprisingly, strictly marking a sender as not spam is overly complicated in
    Gmail / GSuite. Clicking the default "Not spam" button will only mark the
    individual email as not spam. Gmail will eventually learn that the sender is
    not spam, however, to make the sender never be sent to spam <u>now</u>, you
    will have to follow the steps bellow.<br />

  <div>
    <ol>
      <div>
        <li><b>Click the Advanced Search Button</b></li>
        <Image
          class="picture"
          src={advancedSearchImage}
          alt="click the advanced search button"
        />
      </div>

      <div>
        <br /><br />
        <li><b>Create new Filter</b></li>
        <p>
          Add the sender you wish to never send to spam in the "From" search
          field and click "Create Filter"
        </p><br />
        <Image
          class="picture"
          src={createFilterImage}
          alt="fill in the filter form"
        />
      </div>

      <div>
        <br /><br />
        <li><b>Add a Rule for the Filter</b></li>
        <p>
          Click "Never send it to Spam" and then click "Create Filter"<br />
          This will cause all future emails from the sender to be marked as not spam.
          However, this rule will only apply to new emails. All existing emails from
          the sender that are currently in your Spam inbox will not be affected.<br
